# Flappy bird, but with Neuro-Evolution:
This repo is a game of flappy bird, but it learns to play it through NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies).

If you want to run this project, simply run smart_game.py

## Disclaimer
Yes, I know this project has been done numerous times.

However, I've been interested in trying to implement NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) from scratch.

So, I wrote this simple environment to test my custom library.
