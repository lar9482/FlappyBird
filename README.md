# Flappy bird, but with artificial intelligence

## Disclaimer
Yes, I know this project has been done numerous times.

However, I've been interested in trying to implement NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) from scratch.

So, I wrote this simple environment to test my custom library.

If you want to run this project, simply run smart_game.py
